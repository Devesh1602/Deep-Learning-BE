It provides tools for building and training machine learning models, including neural networks.

TensorFlow Image Preprocessing:
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array

These functions are used for loading images from files and converting them to NumPy arrays, respectively. They are commonly used in image preprocessing pipelines for deep learning tasks.

Importing Matplotlib:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
These lines import the Matplotlib library, including the pyplot module as plt, and the image module as mpimg. 
Matplotlib is a plotting library in Python that provides functions for visualizing data, including images.

Specifying Image Path:
image_path = 'Train/Train/Healthy/8ce77048e12f3dd4.jpg'
This line specifies the file path to the image you want to display. It points to a JPEG image located in the 'Train/Train/Healthy' directory.

Loading and Displaying the Image:
img = mpimg.imread(image_path)
plt.imshow(img)
plt.show()
mpimg.imread(image_path) loads the image located at image_path into a NumPy array.
plt.imshow(img) displays the image represented by the NumPy array img using Matplotlib.
plt.show() displays the image plot.

Importing ImageDataGenerator:
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
This line imports the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras' image preprocessing module.
ImageDataGenerator is used for real-time data augmentation and preprocessing of image data during training.

Setting up Train and Test Data Generators:
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, shear_range=0.2, zoom_range=0.2, horizontal_flip=True)
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
These lines create instances of the ImageDataGenerator class for training and testing data, respectively.
For the training data generator (train_datagen), several augmentation techniques are applied:
rescale=1./255: Rescales pixel values to the range [0, 1].
shear_range=0.2: Applies shear transformations with a range of 0.2.
zoom_range=0.2: Applies random zooms with a range of 0.2.
horizontal_flip=True: Randomly flips images horizontally.
For the testing data generator (test_datagen), only rescaling is applied (rescale=1./255), as data augmentation is not performed on the testing data.

Setting up Train Generator:
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('G:\DEEP LEARNING\Train\Train',
                                                    target_size=(225, 225),
                                                    batch_size=32,
                                                    class_mode='categorical')
This line creates a directory iterator for the training data using the flow_from_directory() method of the train_datagen object.
The first argument specifies the directory containing the training images ('G:\DEEP LEARNING\Train\Train').
target_size=(225, 225) specifies the size to which all images will be resized during preprocessing.
batch_size=32 specifies the batch size for training.
class_mode='categorical' indicates that the generator will yield one-hot encoded labels for categorical classification tasks.

Setting up Validation Generator:
validation_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory('G:\DEEP LEARNING\Validation\Validation',
                                                        target_size=(225, 225),
                                                        batch_size=32,
                                                        class_mode='categorical')
This line creates a directory iterator for the validation data using the flow_from_directory() method of the test_datagen object.
The first argument specifies the directory containing the validation images ('G:\DEEP LEARNING\Validation\Validation').
target_size=(225, 225) specifies the size to which all images will be resized during preprocessing (consistent with the training data).
batch_size=32 specifies the batch size for validation.
class_mode='categorical' indicates that the generator will yield one-hot encoded labels for categorical classification tasks.

Importing Necessary Modules:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
These lines import the necessary modules from Keras to define and build the CNN model.

Defining the Model:
model = Sequential()
This line initializes a Sequential model, which allows you to build a neural network by adding layers sequentially.

Adding Convolutional Layers:
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), input_shape=(225, 225, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
These lines add convolutional layers (Conv2D) followed by max-pooling layers (MaxPooling2D) to the model.
The first convolutional layer has 32 filters/kernels of size 3x3, and it expects input images of shape (225, 225, 3) (225x225 pixels with 3 color channels - RGB).
The activation function used is ReLU (activation='relu'), which introduces non-linearity.
Max-pooling layers with a pool size of (2, 2) are added after each convolutional layer to downsample the feature maps.

Flattening Layer:
model.add(Flatten())
This line adds a flattening layer (Flatten) to the model, which flattens the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector. This prepares the data for input into the fully connected layers.

Adding Fully Connected Layers:
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
These lines add fully connected layers (Dense) to the model.
The first fully connected layer has 64 units/neurons with ReLU activation.
The final output layer has 3 units (corresponding to the number of classes) with softmax activation, which produces probability scores for each class.

optimizer='adam'
This parameter specifies the optimization algorithm to use during training. In this case, 'adam' refers to the Adam optimizer,
which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that's well-suited for training deep neural networks.

Loss Function:
loss='categorical_crossentropy'
This parameter specifies the loss function to use during training. 'categorical_crossentropy' is a common choice for multi-class classification problems
with one-hot encoded labels. It computes the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities and the true one-hot encoded labels. 

Metrics:
metrics=['accuracy']
This parameter specifies the evaluation metric(s) to monitor during training. Here, 'accuracy' is chosen as the metric, which measures the proportion of correctly classified samples.

Training the Model:
history = model.fit(train_generator,
                    batch_size=16,
                    epochs=20,
                    validation_data=validation_generator,
                    validation_batch_size=16
                    )
This line trains the model using the fit() method of the model object.
train_generator is used as the training data source, providing batches of augmented and preprocessed images along with their corresponding labels.
batch_size=16 specifies the number of samples per gradient update. In each training iteration, the model will be updated based on gradients computed from 16 samples.
epochs=20 specifies the number of training epochs, i.e., the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset.
validation_data=validation_generator specifies the validation data source, providing batches of preprocessed validation images and labels.
validation_batch_size=16 specifies the batch size for the validation data.
The training progress and evaluation metrics (e.g., loss and accuracy) for both training and validation datasets will be stored in the history object.
